# Linear Regression

This is my repository for my march madness regression project.
The main file has all the code needed to run to view the process and results of this project
The text file has 2 txt files which were imported into the code for convenience
The csv file has all csvs that were created and used throughout the project
The joblib file features the best model based off my testing

In the project I use pandas, sql, numpt, psycog2, sklearn, requests, matplotlib, and joblib libraries in order to pull data regarding college basketball teams. I then cleaned the data in order to preform regression and see which stats havethe highest correlation to march madness wins,.
I then train a number of regression models to make predictions on how many wins a team will get in march madnes. Visualizing how accurate those predictions were, seeing what teams overpreformed, and underpreformed the most, and finaly creating predictions for which teams would have preformed the best in the cancelled 2020 march madness
